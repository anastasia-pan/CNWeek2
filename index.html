    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h2>Interests</h2>

    <p>
      My interests include science fiction, cycling, linguistics and other
      languages, and programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter is a relatively recent interest, as it combines my love of
      learning new languages with the love of problem-solving. It has led me to
      joing the Code Nation programming bootcamp
    </p>
    <p>My favourite Sci fi books:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (aka Blade Runner) - Philip K. Dick
      </li>
      <li>Dune - Frank Herbert</li>
      <li>Embassytown - China Mieville</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Favourite food</h3>
    <p>
      I have a deep fascination with East Asian food, and two of my favourite
      cuisines are Japanese and Korean. Here are some of my favourites:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Ramen in bone broth soup is one my favourite winter meals</li>
      <li>Sushi</li>
      <li>Tteokboki: simmered rice cake in spicy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <code>let Hello = "Hello World!"</code>
    <p>
      I have spent most of my professional life working in science publishing,
      project managing all aspects of production. <br />
      Having recently transitioned into learning how to program, my aspirations
      include, becomong proficient in a few back-end programming languages,
      learning the basics of front-end languages and building a portfolio
      website to present to employers.
